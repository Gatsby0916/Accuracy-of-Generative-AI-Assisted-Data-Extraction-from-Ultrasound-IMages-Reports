Findings
Radiologist: CHONG, WOON KIT
MRI PELVIS
Summary:
No Mullerian duct abnormality.
Single subendometrial cyst left fundus which may reflect a focus of adenomyosis. No diffuse disease.
Thickening and fluid at the torus uterinus with retroverted morphology may be secondary to an endometriotic plaque. No altered
T1 signal or infiltrating disease
No endometriomas or hydrosalpinx. A small amount of fluid in the pelvis thought within physiological limits.
Clinical:
Recurrent implantation failure for investigation.
Technique:
Multi-parametric pelvic MRI fertility protocol including Volumetric 3D Coronal T2 plus reconstructions, T1 axial pre/post fat saturation.
Findings:
Uterus:
Size & morphology: 60ccs (4.0 x 4.9 x 5.8cm). Retroverted retroflexed.
Endometrial thickness: 8mm.
Junctional zone: Anterior maximal junctional zone thickness 6mm.
Posterior maximal junctional zone thickness 7mm.
Fundal maximal junctional zone thickness 4mm.
There are endometrial cysts seen in:
1.Anterior left body measuring 2mm.
2.Right fundus measuring 2mm.
Left subendometrial cyst left anterior fundus measuring 2mm. Focus of adenomyosis a possibility. No diffuse disease identified.
