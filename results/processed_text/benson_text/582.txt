Summary:
No septum or duplication nor definite endocavitatory lesion on current study. No gross synechiae.

Extensive peritoneal scarring presumed sequelae of old endometriosis/ fibrosis, but no deeply infiltrating lesions visible at MRI.
Clinical:
P0+0 laparoscopy and hysteroscopy late 2019 for recurrent ovarian cyst.
Findings - mucinous cystadenoma, endometrial polyp suggestion of atypia, two deep infiltrative spots of endometriosis excised. Recent
scan suggested adeno + nat killer cells suggestive of adeno but ..........++ 2 euploid embryo transfers not preg.
