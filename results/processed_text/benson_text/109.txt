MRI PELVIS
Summary :
Large endometriotic deposit at the taurus uterinus with resulting retroflexed uterine morphology. Adherence of the left and right
ovaries as well as involvement of the pouch of Douglas/mesorectal fascia. Right ovary also appears adherent to a short segment
distal sigmoid.
Multiple endometriomas in the ovaries bilaterally. Short segment hydrosalpinx left infundibulum.
No endometriotic deposit confidently identified in the rectum which contains moderate amounts of faecal material.
No mullerian duct abnormality or adenomyosis.
Clinical:
Endometriosis seen on ultrasound including rectal nodule 18mm from anal verge. Whether there is rectal muscle involvement?
Technique:
1.5 Tesla multi-parametric pelvic MRI fertility protocol including Volumetric 3D Coronal T2 plus reconstructions, T1 axial pre/post fat
saturation.
Findings:
Uterus:
Size & morphology: 78cc (4.2 x 4.5 x 7.9cm). Anteverted retroflexed.
Endometrial thickness: 14mm.
Junctional zone:
Anterior maximal junctional zone thickness 4mm.
Posterior maximal maximal junctional zone thickness 8mm.
Fundal maximal junctional zone thickness 4mm.
No subendometrial cyst. No features of adenomyosis.
Uterine lesions: Endometriotic deposit in the taurus uterinus with myometrial extension. Resulting retroflexed morphology. Area of
involvement estimated at 16mm.

Cervix and vagina:
Nabothian cysts in the endocervical canal. Otherwise unremarkable morphology.
Left ovary:
Position: Medialised and adherent to the posterior left uterine body.
Size: 10.1cc (2.7 x 3.1 x 2.3cm).
Follicle(s): Greater than 12.
Lesions and/or endometrioma: Two endometriomas seen measuring 13mm and 3mm.
Right ovary:
Position: Medialised and adherent to the posterior right uterus.
Size: 15.4cc (2.9 x 3.5 x 2.9cm).
Follicle(s): Greater than 12.
Lesions and/or endometrioma: Three are seen measuring 22mm, 6mm and 6mm respectively.
Adnexa:
Short segment dilated tubular structure around the left ovary suggestive of short segment hydrosalpinx.
Other findings:
Taurus uterinus endometriotic deposit also appears to adhere the left and right ovaries. Associated thickening of the rectovesical pouch.
Right ovary also appears adherent to the anterior serosal surface distal sigmoid for a length of 1.5cm.
Close examination of the rectum shows no endometriotic deposit 2cm from the anocutaneous junction or dentate line.
