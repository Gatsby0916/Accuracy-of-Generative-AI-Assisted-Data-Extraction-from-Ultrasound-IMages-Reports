Abnormal uterovesical space.
Focus of external uterine adenomyosis as described contacting serosa of right urinary bladder fundus without mural thickening or
intraluminal abnormality to suggest full thickness muscle involvement.

Other findings:
Small bowel closely applied to parietal peritoneum overlying the uterine body suggesting non obstructive adhesion.
