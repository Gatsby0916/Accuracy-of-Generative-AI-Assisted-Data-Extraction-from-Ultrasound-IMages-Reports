Findings
Radiologist: VOYVODIC, FRANK
MRI PELVIS
Summary:
17cm central pelvic mass appears right ovarian in origin.
Appearances suggest ovarian tumour without specific features (consider germ cell tumour, epithelial stromal and sex cord
stromal tumours).
The central pelvic location, intralesional haemorrhage and twisted vascular pedicle suggest potential partial torsion although I
note no history of severe pelvic pain.
Normal morphology left ovary.
Small volume free pelvic fluid.
No lymphadenopathy.
Bilateral mild hydronephrosis.
Dr Thompson contacted by telephone.
Clinical:
Large pelvic mass.
Technique:
1.5T multiplanar MR imaging including post IV Gadolinium diffusion weighted imaging.
Comparison films:
Pelvic ultrasound 18/6/2021.
Findings:
Uterus:
Morphology:
Midline anteverted anteflexed mildly tilted to the right.
No septum or duplication.

Size (corpus plus cervix):
6.2 x 4.7 x 2.4cm.
Myometrium:
No masses.
Normal junctional zone thickening.
No evidence of adenomyosis or leiomyomata.
Endometrium:
4mm thick.
No polyp, mass or adhesions.
Cervix:
Normal.
Vagina:
Normal morphology.
Ovaries:
Right ovary:
Large anterior central pelvic mass with maximum dimension 17.0 x 9.4 x 10.4cm highly likely right ovarian in origin. Anterior solid and
posterior cytsic components.
12cm vascularised soft tissue component anteriorly with some central T1 hyperintensity in avascular component suggesting haemorrhage.
There is no evidence of haemosiderin to suggest endometrioma.
No intralesional fat to confirm dermoid.
The intralesional haemorrhagic change and ectopic location of the mass with twisted vascular pedicle in the right adnexa suggest the
presence of torsion of pre-existing ovarian neoplasm.
Left ovary:
Position:
2.7 x 1.7 x 3.3cm.
Multifollicular morphology.
No mass.
Normal position lateral adnexa.
Adnexa:
No tubal dilatation identified.
Small volume free fluid anterior pelvis.
Other findings:
Upper abdomen review reveals normal basal thorax, liver, spleen, adrenal glands and pancreas.
