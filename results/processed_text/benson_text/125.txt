Referring Physician: YOONG, RAY Modality: MR

Findings
Radiologist: JENKINS, MELISSA
MRI PELVIS
Summary:
Fibrotic plaque at the posterior uterus/torus uterinus, with ovaries appearing adherent. Fibrosis is seen extending to the rectum,
but without the degree of upper rectal adherence evident on the previous study. No microcyst within the posterior uterine plaque
to suggest glandular activity.
10mm right endometrioma.
Clinical:
Grade IV endo before with bowel involvement. Surgery 2014. To assess for adhesions and nodules.
Technique:
Multi-parametric pelvic MRI fertility protocol including Volumetric 3D Coronal T2 plus reconstructions, T1 axial pre/post fat saturation.
Comparison Study:
4/7/2014.
Findings:
Day 26 of cycle. G0P0.
Uterus:
Size & morphology: Anteverted minimally retroflexed uterus measures 6.7 x 4.4 x 5.1cm. Minor arcuate configuration with no septum or
duplication.
Endometrial thickness: 9mm thickness. No internal uterine contents.
Junctional zone: Currently no junctional zone expansion to support underlying adenomyosis. No submucosal microcyst formation.
Maximal JZ thickness as follows:
Anterior JZ: 5mm
Fundal JZ: 3mm
Posterior JZ: 6mm

Uterine lesions: Some thickening at the serosal surface of the posterior uterus, consistent with fibrotic endometriosis. No microcyst
formation suggestive of current glandular activity. No uterine fibroid.
Cervix & Vagina:
Unremarkable.
Left Ovary:
Position: Superior left adnexa. Abuts uterine fundus.
Size: 5cc (2.5 x 1.8 x 2.1cm).
Follicle(s): 7 follicles at 5mm or less. Collapsing follicle at 16mm.
Lesions and/or endometrioma: None identified.
Right Ovary:
Position: Central right adnexa, adherent uterine fundus.
Size: 6cc (2.4 x 1.7 x 2.7cm).
Follicle(s): 10 follicles at 7mm or less.
Lesions and/or endometrioma: One endometrioma measuring 10mm.
Adnexa:
Medialised ovaries. There is once again fibrotic thickening at the posterior cul-de-sac and torus uterinus, however although some low T2
fibrosis is seen extending to the upper rectum, this appears less adherent than on the previous study. Fibrotic plaque at the posterior uterus
is again evident, however without T2 hyperintensity to suggest glandular activity on today's study.
There is no hydrosalpinx.
Other Findings:
Nil significant.
