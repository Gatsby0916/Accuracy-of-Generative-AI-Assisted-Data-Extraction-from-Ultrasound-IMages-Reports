Minimum thickness of at least 5mm between outer margin and posterior uterine serosa.
44mm intramural lesion right lower segment compresses the lower segment endometrial cavity without submucosal extension. Outer
margin extends to the uterine serosa.
Innumerable further leiomyoma are present (over 30).

the right.
Endometrium:
2-4mm thick.
Upper cavity distorted by the posterior submucosal leiomyoma. No endocavitary lesion.
Cervix:

Vagina:
Normal posterior vaginal fornix.
Ovaries:
Right ovary:
Position: Posteromedial adnexa adherent to posterior uterus and left ovary.
Size: 3.7 x 2.5 x 4.1cm.

Follicle Count: 11<10mm.
19mm endometriotic cyst.
