MRI PELVIS
Summary:
Abnormal endometrial cavity with focal microcystic mass anterior uterine body/fundus. Further definition may be obtained with
ultrasound/ saline infusion sonohysterogram, but ultimately, hysteroscopic biopsy is suggested.
No MRI scan evidence of adenomyosis, leiomyoma or cul-de-sac endometriosis.
Bilateral normo-follicular ovarian morphology.
Left puborectalis muscle detached suggests previous birth related trauma.
Clinical:
Recurrent IVF/implantation problems.
Technique:
1.5T multiplanar phase array surface coil MR imaging. Day 20 menstrual cycle. G2P1.
Findings:
Uterus:
Morphology:
Neutral version, retroflexion, midline.
Convex external uterine fundal contour - no septum or duplication.
Size: (uterine corpus)
5.6 x 5.0 x 4.2cm (62cc)
Cervix length 27mm.
Adenomyosis:
Submucosal microcysts not identified.
Anterior uterus max JZ thickness 6mm

Leiomyoma:
Absent.
Endometrial cavity:
Maximum thickness 12mm.
Focal mass with microcystic characteristics is noted involving the anterior body and fundal endometrium over a distance of 34 x 9 x 17mm.
Morphology and signal intensities are not typical of soft tissue polyp or submucosal leiomyoma.
Attachment anterior uterus mucosa with some focal loss of definition of the endometrial/myometrial interface.
Cervix:
Normal.
Vagina:
Normal posterior vaginal fornix.
Left puborectalis muscle detachment likely related past birth trauma with some loss of paravaginal support.
Ovaries:
Right ovary -
position lateral adnexa
size 3.7 x 2.9 x 1.7cm (9.6cc)
follicle count 12 less than 10mm.
No mass or endometriotic cyst.
Left ovary -
position lateral adnexa
size 4.3 x 4.0 x 1.9cm (17.1cc)
follicle count 20 less than 10mm, one at 15mm.
No mass or endometriotic cyst.
Adnexa:
No tubal dilatation. Physiologic volume fluid anterior and posterior cul-de-sac - no obliteration, adhesions or infiltrating endometriosis
identified.
Other Findings:
Normal morphology urinary bladder, urethra and rectosigmoid colon.
