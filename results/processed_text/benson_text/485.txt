Date of Birth: January 17, 1996 Requested Procedure: 5646813
Home Phone: 82782452 Procedure Description: MRI PELVIS
Referring Physician: MEZZINI, TONIA Modality: MR
Organization: North Adelaide
Findings
Radiologist: VOYVODIC, FRANK
MRI PELVIS
Summary :
Regional anatomic distortion at posterior pelvis suggesting adhesions involving retroflexed tilted uterus and posterior margin
right ovary.
Appearances suggest pelvic endometriosis - no rectosigmoid bowel involvement.
Focal adjacent posterior uterine body changes ? focal adenomyosis (contacts junctional zone) versus uterine invasive
endometriosis (former favoured as there appears to be some intervening myometrium between the outer margin of the lesion and
the posterior cul-de-sac disease.
Clinical:
Exclude pelvic endometriosis.
Technique:
1.5T multiplanar MR imaging.
Findings:
Uterus:
Morphology:
Anteverted acutely retroflexed, fundus tilted and displaced to the left.
Convex external uterine fundal contour - no septum or duplication.
Size:
(Corpus plus cervix).
6.5 x 5.5 x 4.4cm (82cc)
Adenomyosis:
1.9 x 1.8 x 2.1cm persistent mass posterior myometrium uterine fundus/body.
Ill-defined and contains a haemorrhagic microcyst.
Extends to the junctional zone which shows no diffuse thickening and the diagnosis of focal adenomyoma is favoured over the differential
diagnosis which is uterine invasive endometriosis.

Leiomyoma:
Absent.
Endometrium:
2-3mm thickness.
No polyp, mass or adhesions.
Cervix:
Normal.
Vagina:
Elevated posterior fornix.
Normal rectocervical septum.
Ovaries:
Right ovary:
Position: Lateral.
Size: 2.6 x 2.1 x 2.6cm
Follicle Count:25+ less than 10mm.
No mass or endometriotic cyst.
Left ovary:
Position: Left adnexa.
Size: 1.9 x 1.2 x 3.1cm.
Follicle Count: 19 less than 10mm.
No mass or endometriotic cyst.
Adnexa:
Non nodular T2 hypointense thickening of the uterosacral ligaments is present bilaterally contacting the posterior uterine body serosa and
the posterior margin of the right ovary.
Appearances suggest endometriosis - no large or infiltrating plaque is identified
The posterior uterine body change favoured as adenomyoma rather than invasive endometriosis disease.
Normal rectosigmoid morphology - no serosal tethering or transmural endometriosis involvement.
No tubal dilation.
Normal anterior pelvis.
Normal urinary bladder, urethra, anterior abdominal wall and perineum.
Normal ureters.
Mild L5-S1 degenerative disc disease noted without focal herniation.
