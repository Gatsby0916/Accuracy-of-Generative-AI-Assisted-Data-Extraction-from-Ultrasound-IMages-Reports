This deposit is tethered to the anterior wall of the upper rectum 15cm above the anal verge and there is full thickness muscle invasion with
anterior rectal wall endometrioma present measuring 13 x 8 x 11mm.
Small amount of free fluid in the posterior cul-de-sac indicates patency.
The adjacent sigmoid colon does not appear involved.
Normal anterior abdominal wall, inguinal canals and pelvic side wall.
Normal visualised sacrococcygeal spine and levator ani musculature.
