Findings
Radiologist: JENKINS, MELISSA
MRI PELVIS
Summary:
Multifibroid uterus. No submucosal lesion or significant endocavitary fibroid.
There is a tiny 3mm hypointense focus to the left side of the endometrial cavity with reduced cavitary distension which may
reflect a small adhesion or polyp.
Bilateral haemorrhagic ovarian follicles/cysts with additionally a tiny 5mm right endometrioma.
Clinical:
Secondary infertility. Large fibroids. Ultrasound view could not define projection into cavity. To exclude endocavitary projection.
Technique:
Multi-parametric pelvic MRI fertility protocol including Volumetric 3D Coronal T2 plus reconstructions, T1 axial pre/post fat saturation. Day
22 of cycle. G1 P0.
Findings:
Uterus:
Size & morphology: Anteflexed uterus measures 82 x 90 x 66mm. Conventional morphology. No septum or duplication.
Endometrial thickness: 5mm thickness. At the left side of the mid uterus there is a small 3mm low T2 focus which has an adjacent 4mm
endometrial cyst. Tiny polyp here is a consideration.
Junctional zone: No junctional zone expansion or submucosal microcyst formation to support underlying adenomyosis.
Uterine lesions: There are multiple uterine fibroids. At least eleven fibroids seen. No submucosal or endocavitary lesions. Largest fibroid as
follows:
1.Posterior intramural 36mm
2.Fundal intramural 26mm
3.Anterior left intramural/subserosal 23mm
4.Left anterior intramural inferior 20mm
5.Anterior right intramural/subserosal 17mm
