Bilateral multifollicular ovarian morphology.
Normal hip joints.
Normal pubic symphysis and sacroiliac joints.
Transitional vertebra at the lumbosacral junction with right sided hemisacralisation with degenerative articulation noted.

1.5T multiplanar phased array surface coil MR imaging.

Uterus:
Morphology:
Midline anteverted anteflexed.
Convex external uterine fundal contour - no septum or duplication.
Size (corpus + cervix):
7.8 x 4.3 x 3.4cm.

Persistent mild thickening (9mm) of the junctional zone in the anterior uterus is associated with some endometrial cavity distortion and likely
reflects persistent myometrial contraction rather than superficial focal adenomyosis.
