Radiologist: JENKINS, MELISSA
MRI PELVIS
Summary :
Suboptimal timing with scanning at day 2 of cycle. There is, however, junctional zone expansion supporting adenomyosis.
An 11mm focal region in the lower endometrial cavity may reflect an endometrial polyp, however haemorrhagic focus is possible,
and sonographic correlate to assess for persistent finding is suggested.
No deep/infiltrating endometriotic deposit or uterine fibroid.
Clinical:
1 x NVD. Low ovarian reserve. Very heavy periods. Uterus bulky on screening ultrasound ?adenomyosis/endometriosis.
Technique:
Multi-parametric pelvic MRI fertility protocol including Volumetric 3D Coronal T2 plus reconstructions, T1 axial pre/post fat saturation.
Day 2 of cycle. G2P1.
Findings:
Uterus:
Size & morphology: Anteverted uterus measures 89 x 52 x 61mm.
Endometrial thickness: 8mm. There is a 11 x 6 x 9mm focus seen in the lower endometrial cavity which may reflect an endometrial polyp
though given day 2 of cycle some haemorrhagic products not excluded.
Junctional zone: Poorly defined and thickened measuring up to 17mm posteriorly. No submucosal microcyst formation.
Uterine lesions: Nil focal.
Cervix & vagina:
NAD.
