Posterior cul-de-sac and left pelvic scarring with presumed left ovarian adhesion to uterus.

corpus) 67 x 34 x 40mm.
Leiomyomata: 10mm subserosal non degenerate fibroid at fundus. No other significant leiomyomata.
Junctional zone: Anterior 11mm, fundal 8mm, posterior 6mm. No definite subendometrial cystic change but suggestive of anterior
adenomyosis.
Endometrium: 4mm. No endometrial lesion. No polyp or other endocavitary lesion.
Cervix:
24mm. Nabothian cysts noted. No other abnormality shown.

Lesions and/or endometrioma: No definite haemorrhagic cyst or endometrioma. The immediately adjacent fundal subserosal fibroid
measuring 11mm is noted.
Right ovary:
Position: Right lateral pelvic lie.
Size: 17 x 24 x 19mm, 4cc.
Lesions and/or endometrioma: No haemorrhagic cyst or endometriomata.
Other findings:
Small volume hypointense scarring anterior and posterior cul-de-sac.
Some small superficial hypointense nodules dorsal surface uterine corpus measuring 4mm probable superficial endometriotic plaques. No
active plaques/ hemorrhage by MRI signal. No definite deeply infiltrating disease is shown.
No pelvic collection. Colonic diverticular disease with no acute inflammatory change at pelvic bowel loops. Moderate lower lumbar facet
degenerative change.
