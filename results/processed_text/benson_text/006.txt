Findings
Radiologist: JENKINS, MELISSA
MRI PELVIS
Summary :
Large 10.8mm right uterine fibroid displacing endometrium to the left. Heterogeneous in appearance, however without any
invasive features or haemorrhage to suggest leiomyosarcoma. No lymphadenopathy.
Some encysted fluid within the right adnexa may reflect partial hydrosalpinx versus loculated fluid. No deep/infiltrating
endometriotic deposit, or polycystic ovarian morphology.
Clinical:
Large fibroid on ultrasound. Rapid growth ?any other sinister feature for leiomyosarcoma.
Technique:
Multi-parametric pelvic MRI fertility protocol including Volumetric 3D Coronal T2 plus reconstructions, T1 axial pre/post fat saturation.
T3P3.
Findings:
Uterus:
Size & morphology: Anteverted uterus measures 14.5 x 10 x 10cm. Large size relates to the known large uterine fibroids. Morphology
appears conventional noting displacement of the endometrium to the left by the large fibroids.
Endometrium: Displaced but not thickened. Approximately 6mm thickness. No convincing lesion.
Junctional zone: No JZ expansion or submucosal microcyst formation to support adenomyosis.
Uterine lesions: Very large 11.8cm fibroid occupies the majority of the uterus. Intramural displacing endometrium to the left, with
submucosal abutment. Lesion appears circumscribed, with defined rather than infiltrating margins. Heterogeneous appearance, however no
internal haemorrhage.
Cervix & vagina:
NAD
Left ovary:
Position: Left adnexa.

Size: 13cc (3.4 x 2 x 3.6cm).
Follicle(s): Collapsing follicle/corpus luteum 20mm. Nine subcentimetre follicles.
Lesions and/or endometrioma: None identified.
Right ovary:
Position: Displaced superior to the uterus within the right pelvis.
Size: 6cc (1.8 x 3.3 x 2.0cm).
Follicle(s): 13 follicles at 8mm or less.
Lesions and/or endometrioma: None identified.
Adnexa:
Small volume of free fluid within the pelvis, physiological in amount.
There is a 38 x 12 x 22mm fluid focus within the right adnexa potentially loculated fluid or partial hydrosalpinx. No concerning features.
No deep/infiltrating endometriotic deposit.
Other findings:
Right puborectalis is thinned relative to left with partial detachment favoured. Nil other significant.
