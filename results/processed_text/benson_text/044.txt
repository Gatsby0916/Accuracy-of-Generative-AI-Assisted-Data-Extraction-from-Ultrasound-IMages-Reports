Findings
Radiologist: VOYVODIC, FRANK
MRI PELVIS
Summary :
Marked lateral uterine flexion associated with focal full thickness myometrial pathology at the left fundus contiguous with the
junctional zone.
Most likely diagnosis is focal deeply infiltrative uterine adenomyosis as there is no evidence of cul-de-sac abnormality to suggest
widespread pelvic endometriosis.
Note imaging overlap between endometriosis and adenomyosis and adhesions on the left pelvic sidewall would help to explain
the uterine distortion.
No evidence of MÃ¼llerian duct anomaly, leiomyoma or tubal dilatation.
Normo-follicular ovarian morphology.
Clinical:
Recurrent IVF failure for investigation ? adenomyosis.
Technique:
3T multiplanar MR imaging. Phased array surface coil imaging. Intravenous Buscopan. Day 24 menstrual cycle. G2 P0.
Findings:
Uterus:
Morphology:
Anteverted anteflexed markedly tilted to the right.
Convex external uterine fundal contour - no septum or duplication.
Size:
7.8 x 5.3 x 4.2cm (91cc)
Adenomyosis:
Anterior uterus max JZ thickness 6mm
Posterior uterus max JZ thickness 6mm.
Fundal uterus max JZ thickness 5mm.

Ill defined mass centred on the left uterine cornu with microcystic change and T2 hypointensity measuring up to 3cm in diameter with full
thickness involvement to the uterine serosa.
Appearances are consistent with focally deeply invasive adenomyosis. Note overlap with appearance of focally invasive endometriosis.
Leiomyoma:
Absent.
Endometrium:
8mm thickness. No polyp mass or adhesion.
Cervix:
Nabothian cysts in the internal os. Nil significant.
Vagina:
Normal morphology.
Ovaries:
Right ovary:
Position: Lateral adnexa.
Size: 3.3 x 2.2 x 1.8cm (6.8cc)
Follicle Count: 24 <10mm,
no mass or endometriotic cyst.
Left ovary:
Position: Lateral adnexa adjacent left uterine body fundus.
Size: 3.9 x 1.7 x 2.3cm (8.0cc)
Follicle Count: 13 less than or equal to 10mm.
No mass or endometriotic cyst.
Adnexa:
Physiologic volume of fluid posterior cul-de-sac - no obliteration.
No tubal dilatation.
Normal morphology rectosigmoid colon.
Small bowel closely applied to superior margin uterine fundus - no evidence of regional distortion to support the presence of adhesions.
Anterior cul-de-sac normal.
