Findings
Radiologist: KNOX, STEVEN
MRI PELVIS
Summary :
Conventional uterine anatomy without septum of duplication. No endocavitary pathology. Intramural and subserosal fibroids,
without mass effect on the cavity. No adenomyosis.
Uterine retroflexion although without clear MRI supportive features of posterior cul-de-sac endometriosis/fibrosis. Correlation
with mobility assessment at the time of dynamic ultrasound would be worth while. No previous ultrasound available for review.
There is no hydrosalpinx. Polycystic ovarian morphology.
Clinical:
Two failed FET cycles, check for adenomyosis or other pathology.
Worksheet = Day 25. G1P0 no prior section/surgery.
Technique:
Multi-parametric pelvic MRI fertility protocol including Volumetric 3D Coronal T2 plus reconstructions, T1 axial pre/post fat saturation.
Findings:
Uterus:
Size & morphology: Anteverted retroflexed. Size (uterine body and cervix) 85 x 33 x 43mm. Conventional anatomy without septum or
duplication.
Endometrial thickness: 6mm. There is no endocavitary pathology.
Junctional zone: Junctional zone thickness is appropriate throughout. No submucosal microcysts or features of adenomyosis. Anterior JZ -
6mm.
Fundal JZ - 4mm.
Posterior JZ - 5mm.
Uterine lesions: Three fibroids are identified. These are non degenerate and non suspicious;
1.Posterior left uterine body pedunculated. Subserosal. Base of attachment 20mm. Fibroid size 28 x 28 x 30mm.
2.Pedunculated. Posterior fundal right side. Base of attachment is 8mm. Fibroid size 37 x 19 x 34mm.
3.Intramural left cornua. Size 5mm. Distance of 4mm from mucosal surface and 4mm from serosal surface.

Cervix & vagina:
No cervical or vaginal pathology of concern.
Left ovary:
Position: Left lateral adnexa.
Size: 25 x 16 x 35mm (7.2ml).
Follicle(s): Present. Approximately 20 subcentimetre follicles.
Lesions and/or endometrioma: Not identified.
Right ovary:
Position: Right lateral adnexa.
Size: 29 x 14 x 28mm (9.7ml).
Follicle(s): Present. > 20 subcentimetre follicles. Polycystic morphology.
Lesions and/or endometrioma: Not identified.
Adnexa:
Physiologic fluid within the posterior cul-de-sac. Whilst there is uterine retroflection, the deep posterior cul-de-sac remains outlined by
physiologic fluid and there is no clear evidence of obliterative posterior cul-de-sac endometriosis/fibrosis. No peritoneal inclusion cyst,
hydrosalpinx or other features of concern.
Other findings:
Nil significant.
