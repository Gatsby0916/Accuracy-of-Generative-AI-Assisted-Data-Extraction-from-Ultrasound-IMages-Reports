Summary :
Acute on chronic endometriotic disease in the cul de sac which appears obliterated. Adherent rectum/sigmoid to the posterior
uterine wall. Invasive endometriotic disease seen through the posterior myometrium from fundus to neck. Ovaries difficult to
appreciated. Small cystic areas over the posterolateral walls of the uterus - adherent/incorporated ovaries to areas of invasive
endometriosis?
No hydrosalpinx. No endometriomas. No adenomyosis or mullerian duct abnormality.
Small uterine fibroids.

to this side. Fibroid? Endometriosis?

1.5 Tesla multi-parametric pelvic MRI fertility protocol including Volumetric 3D Coronal T2 plus reconstructions, T1 axial pre/post fat
saturation.

Superior inferior 7.5cm
Anterior posterior 2.8cm
Transverse 8cm.
Mixed signal in an obliterated cul de sac with low and high T1 fat sat signal appreciated. Long segment tethering of adjacent rectosigmoid
involving a length of approximately 4.8cm. Acute on chronic endometriosis with myometrial invasion favoured.

Cervix & vagina:
Normal morphology.
Left ovary:
Difficult to identify.
Right ovary:
Difficult to identify.
There are small cystic areas over the posterolateral uterus with no increased T1 signal changes. Follicles in adherent ovaries?

No hydrosalpinx.
Other findings:
