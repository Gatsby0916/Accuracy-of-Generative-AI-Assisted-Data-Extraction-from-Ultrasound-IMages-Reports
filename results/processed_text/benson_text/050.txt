MRI PELVIS
Summary :
Uterine didelphys, with duplicated cervices and vaginal lumens in addition to the duplicated endometrial cavity. No obstruction of
either hemivagina/cervix.
Bilateral endometriomata, the largest on the left measuring 32mm.
No deep/infiltrating complex endometriosis although some minor adhesions centrally in the lower deep cul de sac are present.
No active hemorrhagic foci or hydrosalpinx. No adenomyosis.
If the upper renal tract has not been previously imaged, given the presence of uterus didelphys in association with renal
agenesis, renal tract ultrasound could be considered.
Clinical:
Likely bicornuate uterus. Left endometrioma. ?extent of endo/anatomy.
Technique:
Multi-parametric pelvic MRI fertility protocol including Volumetric 3D Coronal T2 plus reconstructions, T1 axial pre/post fat saturation.
Day 26 of cycle. G0 P0.
Findings:
Uterus:
Size and Morphology: Anteverted uterus measures 72 x 21 x 55mm. Didelphys morphology, with duplicated endometrial cavities and also
separate cervical canals. There is additionally vaginal duplication, which is best visualised inferiorly.
Endometrial Thickness: Endometrial thickness satisfactory in both hemiuteri, with both measuring 3mm. No gross endocavitary lesion.
Junctional Zone: There is no junctional zone thickening, or submucosal microcyst formation to suggest adenomyosis.
Uterine Lesions: None identified.
Cervix and Vagina:
Both cervix and vagina are duplicated as discussed previously. No obstruction of either cavity.
