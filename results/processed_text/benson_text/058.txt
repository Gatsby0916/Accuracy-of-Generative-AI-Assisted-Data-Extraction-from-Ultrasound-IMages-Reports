Conventional uterine anatomy with no septum or duplication. No uterine lesion, endocavitary pathology or adenomyosis.
Polycystic ovarian morphology. Small endometriotic cyst to both ovaries.
No regional anatomic distortion as imaging evidence of significant regional fibrosis/adhesions. No definable pelvic side wall
endometrioma or deep infiltrating posterior cul-de-sac disease. No hydrosalpinx.

identified.

Left lateral adnexa.
Size:
52 x 18 x 40mm (20ml). Increase. Polycystic morphology.
Follicle(s):
>20cm follicle. No dominant follicle. Polycystic morphology.
Lesions and/or endometrioma:
Two tiny endometriotic cysts present within the left ovary measuring 4 and 3mm respectively.
Right Ovary:
Position:
Right lateral adnexa.
Size:
49 x 27 x 46mm (31ml). Enlargement related to both dominant follicular activity and polycystic morphology.
Follicle(s):
Present. > 20 peripherally placed subcentimetre follicles. Collapsing dominant follicle at 22mm.
Lesions and/or endometrioma:
Present. Approximately four small endometriotic cysts. The largest measuring 10mm.
Adnexa:
Free fluid lies appropriately within the posterior cul-de-sac. There is no posterior cul-de-sac obliteration or deep infiltrating posterior cul-
de-sac disease. No clear regional adhesion. No uterosacral ligament spiculation, nodularity or clear fibrotic change. No pelvic side wall
endometrioma. No regional anatomic distortion.
Other Findings:
Lumbosacral spine unremarkable.
