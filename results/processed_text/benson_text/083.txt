Relatively low position cervix at rest, ? pelvic floor laxity.
Clinical:
IVF failure, check for endometriosis - adenomyosis.
Technique:
1.5T multiplanar phased array surface coil MR imaging. Intravenous buscopan. Late secretory phase cycle. G3P2.

Uterus:

Anteverted retroflexed midline
Convex external uterine fundal contour - no septum or duplication.
Size (corpus plus cervix):
8.9 x 6.6 x 4.9cm (151cc)
Adenomyosis:
Submucosal microcysts not identified.

Size: 2.2 x 4.1 x 1.2cm (5.7cc)
Follicle Count: 8 < 5mm.
No masses or endometriotic cysts.
Left Ovary:
Position: Lateral adnexa.

Follicle Count: 9 < 5mm, 1 at 9mm.
No masses or endometriotic cysts.
Adnexa:
No tubal dilatation. Physiologic volume fluid posterior cul-de-sac - no masses, adhesions or infiltrating endometriosis.
Other Findings:
Relatively low position of cervix in relation to the pelvic floor at rest raises the possibility of pelvic floor laxity.
Intact pelvic floor musculature - no puborectalis detachment.
Normal morphology rectosigmoid colon.
Colonic faecal loading noted incidentally.
