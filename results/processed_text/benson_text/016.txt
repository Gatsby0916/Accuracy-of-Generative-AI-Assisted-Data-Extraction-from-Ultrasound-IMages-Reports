Radiologist: CHONG, WOON KIT
PELVIC MRI
Summary :
Arcuate configuration to the uterus.
No direct evidence of adenomyosis although the junctional zone measurements are borderline (between 8-12mm).
No endometriomas, hydrosalpinx or gross pelvic adhesions/endometriotic deposits.
Note mild thickening of the uterosacral ligaments suggesting some mild regional fibrosis/ old endometriosis. No gross features.
Clinical:
Adenomyosis.
Technique:
Multi-parametric pelvic MRI fertility protocol including Volumetric 3D Coronal T2 plus reconstructions, T1 axial pre/post fat saturation.

Size & morphology: 69cc (3.9 x 4.6 x 7.3cm). Arcuate configuration. Anteverted uterus.
Endometrial thickness: 8mm.
Junctional zone: Anterior maximal junctional zone thickness 8mm. Posterior maximal junctional zone thickness 9mm, fundal maximal
junctional zone thickness 5mm.
No subendometrial cysts. No definite MR evidence of adenomyosis.
Uterine lesions: Nil.
Cervix & vagina:
Nabothian cysts in the endocervical canal. Otherwise no morphological abnormalities are seen.
Left ovary:

Lesions and/or endometrioma: Nil.
Right ovary:
Position: Superior right adnexa. Close approximation to the uterine fundus although no definite adhesions.
Size: 4.9cc (2.1 x 1.8 x 2.5cm).
Follicle(s): Seven. Subcentimetre.
Lesions and/or endometrioma: Nil.
Adnexa:
No hydrosalpinx.
Other findings:
Small amount of physiological fluid in the pelvis. No significant adhesions identified.
Lumbosacral spine is unremarkable. Posterior annular tears of the L4-5 and L5-S1 disc.
Mild thickening of the uterosacral ligaments suggests some regional fibrosis and possible old endometriosis. Uncomplicated.
