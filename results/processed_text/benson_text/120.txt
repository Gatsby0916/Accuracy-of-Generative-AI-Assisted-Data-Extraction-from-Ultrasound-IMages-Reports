Findings
Radiologist: COWIE, JENNIFER
MRI PELVIS
Summary :
No evidence of adenomyosis. Retroverted uterus, and prominent number of follicles are seen within the bilateral ovaries. Tubular
structure within the right adnexa has close proximity to both the right ovary as well as to a more medialised caecum. Mildly
enlarged fallopian tube is felt more likely than chronically enlarged appendix, and there is no evidence of current inflammatory
change.
Clinical:

Technique:
Multi-parametric pelvic MRI fertility protocol including Volumetric 3D Coronal T2 plus reconstructions, T1 axial pre/post fat saturation.

Junctional zone:
Anterior 4mm

Position:
Left adnexa.
Size:
3.3 x 1.9 x 2.3cm (7.5cc)
Follicle(s):
>25 follicles. The majority between 2-5mm, 1 follicle 12mm.
Lesions and/or endometrioma:
None seen.
Right Ovary:
Position:
Right adnexa.
Size:
4.1 x 1.8 x 2.2cm (8.5cc)
Follicle(s):
>20 follicles are seen. The largest measures 10mm.
Lesions and/or endometrioma:
None seen.
Adnexa:
The right adnexa has a tubular structure leading both to the caecum and the right ovary. It is difficult to ascertain whether this represents a
mildly prominent, 7mm appendix, or a mildly enlarged fallopian tube. No evidence of acute blood products within the region. No evidence of
free fluid identified. No significant inflammatory change.
There is some thickening of the torus uterinus, in keeping with old endometrial deposit, however there is no acute endometriosis seen. No
adnexal mass or free fluid is identified.
Other Findings:
Nil significant.
