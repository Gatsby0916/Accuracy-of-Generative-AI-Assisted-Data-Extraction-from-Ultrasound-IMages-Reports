Findings
Radiologist: KNOX, STEVEN
MRI PELVIS
Summary :
Conventional uterine anatomy. Uterine retroflexion with some suspicion for chronic fibrosis at the deep posterior cul-de-sac
and also extending along the right uterosacral ligament. In the context of the ovarian endometriotic cysts the cul de sac features
would favour uncomplicated deep posterior cul-de-sac fibrosis and probably old endometriosis. No active hemorrhagic cul de
sac foci are seen. No hydrosalpinx or other definable pelvic pathology.
Clinical:
Recurrent failure IVF. ? Adenomyosis, ? other.
Technique:
Multi-parametric pelvic MRI fertility protocol including Volumetric 3D Coronal T2 plus reconstructions, T1 axial pre/post fat saturation.
Findings:
Worksheet = day 21. G0 P0. Prior laparoscopy 2012.
Uterus:
Size (uterine body and cervix) & morphology: Anteverted retroflexed. 76 x 43 x 59mm. Conventional uterine anatomy with no evidence of
septum or duplication.
Endometrial thickness: ET = 6mm. No endocavitary pathology.
Junctional zone: Normal junctional zone thickness throughout. No junctional zone expansion or submucosal microcyst to support
adenomyosis. The JZ is diffusely measured at 2mm.
Uterine lesions: Not identified.
Cervix & vagina:
No cervical or vaginal lesion.
Left ovary:
Position: Left anterior high adnexa.
Size: 26 x 22 x 35mm (10.4ml).
Follicle(s): Present. Approximately 10 subcentimetre follicles. Two follicles 10-15mm.

Lesions and/or endometrioma: There are approximately three endometriotic cysts. The largest measures 12mm.
Right ovary:
Position: Right lateral adnexa.
Size: 32 x 25 x 41mm (17ml). Enlargement related to multifollicular appearance.
Follicle(s): Present. Approximately 15 subcentimetre follicles. Largest follicle 14mm.
Lesions and/or endometrioma: Approximately three endometriotic cysts. The largest is measured at around 12mm.
Adnexa:
No hydrosalpinx or pelvic side wall endometrioma. Uterine retroflexion is noted and there does appear to be some slight thickening along
particularly the right uterosacral ligament with low T2 signal/fibrosis. The appearances are suggestive of posterior cul-de-sac fibrosis. No
active hemorrhagic foci. Fluid is partially effaced in this region.
Other findings:
No other significant pelvic pathology.
