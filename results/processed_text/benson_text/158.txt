Report Status: Final
Requested Procedure: 6354777
Procedure Description: MRI PELVIS
Referring Physician: NGUYEN, TRAN T T Modality: MR
Organization: North Adelaide
Findings
Radiologist: KNOX, STEVEN
PELVIC MRI
Summary :
Overall size measurements to the uterus are similar to the previous study. Non degenerate/ non suspicious fibroids. The
dominant fibroid shows a very marginal increase in overall size measurement when compared to 18/03/2021. There are no
submucosal fibroids.
Clinical:
G0. Twelve month surveillance of large fibroids. ?Endometriosis.
Technique:
Multi-parametric pelvic MRI fertility protocol including volumetric 3D coronal T2 plus reconstructions, T1 axial pre/post fat saturation.
Comparison Study:
MRI 18/03/2021.
Findings:
Uterus:
Size & morphology: Anteverted/anteflexed. Size (uterine body and cervix) 12.5 x 9.8 x 9.5cm (previous 12.8 x 9.8 x 9.7cm). Stable.
Enlargement related to multiple fibroids.
Endometrial thickness: The cavity is deviated to the right of midline. ET thickness = 6mm. No septum nor duplication.
Junctional zone: Normal. No junctional zone expansion or submucosal microcyst as evidence of adenomyosis.
Uterine lesions: Multiple non degenerate, non suspicious fibroids are identified. Left and fundal exert mass effect on the cavity although
there are no true submucosal fibroids identified. Comparison as follows:
1.Left lateral uterine body intramural. Size 8.7 x 9.0 x 8.6cm (previous 7.9 x 8.1 x 7.6cm). Marginal increase in size. Mass effect on the
cavity with displacement of the endometrium to the right of midline. Serosal and mucosal surface contact.
2.Right anterior fundal inferior. Pedunculated. Maximum diameter 22mm. Previous 23mm. Serosal based attachment 23mm.
Approximately 12mm from mucosal surface. Serosal surface contact.
3.Left lateral lower uterine body. Serosal. Maximum 30mm diameter. Previous 28mm. Approximately 58mm from the mucosal surface.

No cervical or vaginal lesion.
Left ovary:
Position: Left iliac fossa.
Size: 37 x 23 x 24mm (10.6ml). Enlargement related to dominant follicular activity.
Follicle(s): Dominant follicle 17mm.
Lesions and/or endometrioma: Not identified.
Right ovary:
Position: Right lateral superior adnexa.
Size: 22 x 15 x 29mm (5.0ml).
Follicle(s): Present. Approximately 12 subcentimetre follicles.
Lesions and/or endometrioma: Not identified.
Adnexa:
No abnormal fluid or mass. No hydrosalpinx. No features of obliterative posterior cul-de-sac endometriosis/fibrosis. No abnormal thickening
to uterosacral ligament.
Other findings:
Nil significant.
