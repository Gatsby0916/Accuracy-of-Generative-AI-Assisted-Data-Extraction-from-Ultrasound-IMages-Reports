MRI PELVIS
Summary:
Diffuse uterine adenomyosis. No endocavitary pathology. No concerning uterine lesions with a few small intramural fibroids. No
septum or duplication.
Polycystic ovarian morphology. No hydrosalpinx or features or pelvic endometriosis/fibrosis.
Clinical:
Suggestion of adenomyosis on ultrasound.
Technique:
Multi-parametric pelvic MRI fertility protocol including Volumetric 3D Coronal T2 plus reconstructions, T1 axial pre/post fat saturation.
Findings:
Uterus:
Size & morphology: Anteverted minimally anteflex. Size (uterine body and cervix) 90mm x 46mm x 65mm.
Endometrial thickness: ET=7mm. No concerning endocavitary pathology. Small mucosal cyst at the fundus at 2mm.
Junctional zone: There are multifocal submucosal microcysts particularly at the posterior lower uterine body which supports background
adenomyosis. Irregularity and several regions of more focal expansion to the JZ measuring maximum 11mm anteriorly, 12mm fundus and
9mm posteriorly. No discrete adenomyoma.
Uterine lesions: Small intramural fundal fibroid without submucosal projection measuring 9mm x 12mm. 3mm from mucosal surface. 6mm
from serosal surface. There is also a small lower uterine segment mid uterine anterior intramural fibroid at 6mm with a distance of 2mm
from mucosal surface and 4mm from serosal surface.
Cervix & vagina: No cervical or vaginal lesion.
Left ovary:
Position: Left lateral adnexa.
Size: 30mm x 25mm x 33mm (12.5mls). Enlargement related to polycystic ovarian morphology.
