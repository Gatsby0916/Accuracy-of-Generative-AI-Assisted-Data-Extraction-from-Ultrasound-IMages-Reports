Gender: Female Report Status: Final
Date of Birth: March 8, 1990 Requested Procedure: 5790326

Referring Physician: JUNEJA, MONIKA Modality: MR
Organization: Christies Beach
Findings
Radiologist: KNOX, STEVEN
MRI PELVIS
Summary :
No lesion to the ovaries displaying internal haemoconcentration as clear evidence of an endometrioma. No hydrosalpinx. There is
uterine retroflexion, although no deep obliterative posterior cul-de-sac changes are identified. There are thin septations observed
through the fluid within the posterior cul-de-sac which implies tiny adhesions and early peritoneal inclusion cyst formation. This
may be a secondary feature of endometriosis or other pelvic inflammation, however direct evidence is not identified. There is no
architectural distortion. No bowel disease.
Clinical:
Bilateral ovarian endometrioma. Raised ovarian tumour markers ? adenomyosis ? Pouch of Douglas involvement with endometriosis.
Technique:
Multi-parametric pelvic MRI fertility protocol including Volumetric 3D Coronal T2 plus reconstructions, T1 axial pre/post fat saturation.
Findings:
Uterus:
Size & morphology: Anteverted retroflexed. Size (uterine body and cervix) 76 x 43 x 58mm. Conventional uterine anatomy without septum
or duplication. There is an IUCD appropriately in situ, tip position near fundus.
Endometrial thickness: ET=2mm. No endocavitary pathology.
Junctional zone: Normal. No submucosal microcyst or supportive features of adenomyosis. Junctional zone thickness is appropriate
throughout measuring 3mm anterior, 2mm at fundus and 5mm posteriorly.
Uterine lesions: Not identified.
Cervix & vagina:
No pathologic features. Small Nabothian cyst.
Left ovary:
Position: Anterior left hemipelvis.
Size: 44 x 47 x 52mm (56mls). Enlargement related to dominant follicle.
Follicle(s): Present. 48mm simple follicle is within physiologic limits for age. There is no haemoconcentration identified.

Lesions and/or endometrioma: Not identified.
Right ovary:
Position: Right lateral adnexa.
Size: 32 x 21 x 34mm (12mls).
Follicle(s): Present. Approximately 20 subcentimetre follicles.
Lesions and/or endometrioma: Not identified.
Adnexa:
Physiological fluid lays appropriate within the deep posterior cul-de-sac. No obliterative changes identified. I do note some thin septations
within the peritoneal fluid within the deep posterior cul-de-sac which provides support for the presence of minor adhesions and that may
relate to prior inflammatory change although endometriotic implants or bowel wall disease not identified. I note the presence of uterine
retroflexion although a clear plaque to the posterior lower uterine serosa is not identified. No hydrosalpinx.
Other findings:
Moderate colonic faecal loading. No small or large bowel anatomic distortion's identified. There is degenerate change to the lower lumbar
facets.
