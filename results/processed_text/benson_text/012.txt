Findings
Radiologist: KNOX, STEVEN
MRI PELVIS
Summary:
Small area of superficial adenomyosis at the posterior mid to lower uterine body. No diffuse disease identified. No endocavitary
pathology. Small incidental intramural fibroid. No septum or duplication.
Right ovarian endometriotic cyst. Ovarian follicular activity demonstrated. No hydrosalpinx. No features of pelvic endometriosis/
fibrosis.
Clinical:
Day 23 -27 of cycle to assess for adenomyosis.
Worksheet = day 25. G0 P0. No prior surgery.
Technique:
Multi-parametric pelvic MRI fertility protocol including Volumetric 3D Coronal T2 plus reconstructions, T1 axial pre/post fat saturation.
Findings:
Uterus:
Size and Morphology: Retroverted/ anteflexed. Size 86 x 45 x 53mm. Conventional uterine anatomy without septum or duplication.
Endometrial Thickness: ET = 5mm. No endocavitary pathology.
Junctional Zone: There is no junctional zone expansion. Small submucosal microcysts are noted at the lower posterior uterine body. This is
supportive of regional superficial adenomyosis. Junctional zone measures 3mm anteriorly, 3mm at fundus and 5mm posteriorly. No diffuse
disease identified.
Uterine Lesions: There are no submucosal fibroids. A few intramural to subserosal fibroids are identified incidentally. Largest two as
follows:
1.Anterior mid line lower uterine body - 9mm. 4mm from mucosal surface. 4mm from serosal surface.
2.Posterior left intramural/subserosal (approximately 25% subserosal) - 9mm. Serosal surface contact. 12mm from mucosal surface.
Cervix and Vagina:
Simple Nabothian cysts. There are also simple appearing bilateral Bartholin gland cysts, right at 11mm and left at 6mm.

Left Ovary:
Position: Superior left lateral adnexa.
Size: 31 x 18 x 34mm (9.9ml).
Follicle(s): Present. Approximately 15 follicles. Large 8mm.
Lesions and/or Endometrioma: Not identified.
Right Ovary:
Position: Anterior right adnexa/lower pelvis.
Size: 37 x 30 x 42mm (24ml). Enlargement related to dominant follicular activity and underlying endometriotic cyst.
Follicle(s): Present. Approximately 12 follicles. Dominant collapsing follicle 24mm.
Lesions and/or endometrioma: There is also an endometriotic cyst at 17mm present inferiorly.
Adnexa:
Physiological fluid layers appropriately within the deep posterior cul-de-sac. No features of significant posterior cul-de-sac endometriosis/
fibrosis. No gross architectural distortion. No hydrosalpinx.
Other Findings:
Disc degenerate change at L5/S1. No other significant finding.
