Present.
Solitary 12mm diameter non degenerate intramural lesion (FIGO 4) right posterolateral uterine body. No submucosal or endocavitary
lesions.
Endometrium:
10mm thickness. Suspicion of 9mm polyp anterior fundus.
Cervix:
Normal.
Vagina:
Elevated posterior vaginal fornix. Normal rectocervical septum. Otherwise normal morphology.
Ovaries:
Right Ovary
Position: Posteromedial adnexa adjacent uterus.Ovary adherent to posterior cul-de-sac endometriosis.
Size: 3.2 x 2.2 x 2.7cm (10.0cc)
Follicle Count: 14 <10mm.
Two endometriotic cysts measuring 15mm and 6mm in diameter.
Left Ovary
Position: Posteromedial adnexa adherent to posterior caul-de-sac endometriosis.
Size: 4.4 x 2.1 x 3.0cm (14.5cc)
Follicle Count: 7 <10mm, one at 16mm, one at 16mm, one at 12mm.
No discrete endometriotic cysts.
Adnexa:
No tubal dilatation.
Partial obliteration posterior cul-de-sac with infiltrating endometriosis which appears predominantly fibrotic. Associated with adherent fixed
uterine retroflexion and bilateral medialised adherent ovaries in the posterior cul-de-sac. The posterior vaginal fornix is involved. There is no
deep myometrial invasion.
The anterior margin mid rectal serosa appears adherent without evidence of full thickness (i.e. transmural) rectal endometriotic involvement
(limited sensitivity MRI).
Anterior cul-de-sac unremarkable.
Normal morphology urinary bladder, urethra and levator ani musculature.
