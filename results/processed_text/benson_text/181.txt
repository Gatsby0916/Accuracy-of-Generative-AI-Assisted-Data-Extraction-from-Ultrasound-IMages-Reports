AMENDED REPORT
Original Report reported by DR Steven Knox
MRI PELVIS
Summary :
Fibroid uterus. Approximately three endocavitary fibroids and a larger left lateral uterine body fibroid which is intramural
although distorts the cavity. All fibroids are non degenerate and non suspicious based on MR features.
No additional findings of concern. No adenomyosis, ovarian pathology or features of definable pelvic endometriosis.
Clinical:
Uterine fibroids ? cavity impact.
Technique:
Multi-parametric pelvic MRI fertility protocol including Volumetric 3D Coronal T2 plus reconstructions, T1 axial pre/post fat saturation.
Findings:
Uterus:
Size & morphology: Anteflexed. Size (uterine body and cervix) 88 x 50 x 75mm. Fibroid uterus. Conventional uterine anatomy with no
septum or duplication identified.
Endometrial thickness: Cavity is distorted by the larger left sided intramural/submucosal fibroid and with several endocavitary fibroids
present. No discrete polyp. ET= 17mm and is mildly expanded.
Junctional zone: No junctional zone expansion or submucosal microcyst to support background adenomyosis. Anterior JZ - 3mm. Fundal -
4mm. Posterior - 3mm.
Uterine lesions: Several fibroids. Non degenerate non suspicious. Measurements as follows:
1.Posterior intramural with a contacting mucosal lesion. Left uterine body. Displacement of cavity to the right of midline. 2mm from serosal
surface. 51 x 47 x 51mm.
2.Anterior pedunculated mid uterine endocavitary. 19 x 11 x 15mm. Base attachment approximately 7mm.
3.Anterior right body/fundus pedunculated endocavitary. Small. 3mm.

4. Sessile broadbased right fundal endocavitary. Small. 5mm.
Cervix & Vagina:
No suspicious cervical or vaginal features.
Left Ovary:
Position: Superior left adnexa.
Size: 27 x 14 x 24mm (4.7ml).
Follicle(s): Present. Approximately 10 subcentimetre follicles.
Lesions and/or endometrioma: Not identified.
Right Ovary:
Position: Right lateral adnexa.
Size: 31 x 24 x 22mm (8.6ml).
Follicle(s): Present. Approximately 8 subcentimetre follicles. Single follicle 12mm.
Lesions and/or endometrioma: Not identified.
Adnexa:
Free fluid layers appropriate within the posterior cul-de-sac. No features of pelvic endometriosis/fibrosis. No hydrosalpinx. Uterosacral
ligaments appear appropriate. No regional anatomic distortion.
Other Findings:
Nil significant.
