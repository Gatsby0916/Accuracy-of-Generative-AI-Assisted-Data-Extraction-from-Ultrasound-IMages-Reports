MRI PELVIS
Summary:
Background diffuse/infiltrative endometriosis as described. Partial septate uterus morphology. The left ovary would meet the
criteria of PCO morphology and can be correlated with biochemistry.
Clinical:
Recurrent miscarriage and one 22/40 pregnancy loss. ?Septate uterus. ?Adenomyosis ?polyps or fibroids.
Technique:
Routine MRI pelvis.
Findings:
Uterine morphology:
Less than 90Â° angulation between the two uterine horns are demonstrated. The external contour to the uterus however is preserved, and
the distance to the apex measures approximately 28mm. Features would be consistent with a partial septate uterus.
Myometrium:
No myometrial lesions are identified.
Junctional zone:
Preserved.
Endometrium:
Some small endometrial cysts are appreciated at the level of the internal os and extending into the site of a previous caesarean section
scar. No focal abnormality or polyp otherwise is identified.
Cervix and vagina:
Normal appearance.
Bilateral ovaries:
The right ovary measures 49 x 23 x 22mm (14cc).
It does appear to be adherent/tethered to the uterine fundus. No evidence of ovarian lesions. No endometrioma is identified.
The left ovary measures 46 x 29 x 33mm (23cc).

Again, there is a degree of a tethering to the uterine fundus appreciated.
A number of small peripheral follicles are appreciated, and would meet the criteria of PCO morphology.
Torus uterinus:
Mild torus uterinus thickening. Small amount of tethering to the upper rectum also demonstrated at the level of the torus uterinus.
Pelvis:
No free intraperitoneal fluid is identified.
Other findings:
Tarlov cyst within the sacral spine incidentally noted.
