Summary:
Uncomplicated uterine fibroids. There are no features of architectural distortion or other findings suggestive of anterior or
posterior cul-de-sac endometriosis/fibroids. No adenomyosis. No hydrosalpinx. No endocavitary pathology.
Clinical:
Symptoms of severe dysmenorrhoea, pain radiates to the upper abdomen.
Worksheet = approximate day 20. G0 P0. No prior surgery.
Technique:
Multi-parametric pelvic MRI fertility protocol including Volumetric 3D Coronal T2 plus reconstructions, T1 axial pre/post fat saturation.
Findings:
Uterus:
Size & morphology: Anteverted minimally anteflexed. 84 x 46 x 55mm. Conventional uterine anatomy without septum or duplication.
Endometrial thickness: ET=7mm. There is no endocavitary pathology.
Junctional zone: Normal junctional zone thickness throughout. No submucosal microcysts or supportive features of adenomyosis. JZ
measures 5mm diffusely.
Uterine lesions: Non degenerate/non suspicious fibroids present. There are no fibroids with submucosal projection identified. Fibroids are
intramural/subserosal:
1.Right mid anterior uterine body. Intramural/subserosal. Approximately 50% subserosal. Size 12mm. Serosal surface contact. 10mm from
the mucosal surface.
2.Left lateral mid uterine body/fundus. Intramural/subserosal. Approximately 50% exophytic. Size 15mm. Serosal surface contact. Distance
