Findings
Radiologist: KNOX, STEVEN
PELVIC MRI
Summary : Bulky fibroid uterus. The dominant fibroid is posterior pedunculated subserosal filling the posterior cul-de-sac. All
fibroids appear non degenerate, non suspicious. There are no submucosal fibroids or fibroids significantly encroaching on the
cavity.
Superficial adenomyosis left cornua. No endocavitary pathology.
Normal ovarian follicular activity. The right ovary is displaced into the iliac fossa.
Clinical:
Multi fibroid uterus. 10cm.
Technique:
Multi-parametric pelvic MRI fertility protocol including Volumetric 3D Coronal T2 plus reconstructions, T1 axial pre/post fat saturation.
Findings:
Uterus:
Size & morphology: Anteverted retroflexed. Retroflexion appears related to the large posterior fibroid. Size: 10.2 x 10.8 x 9.7cm.
Conventional uterine anatomy without septum or duplication.
Endometrial thickness: ET = 11mm. No endocavitary pathology. No polyp.
Junctional zone: Submucosal microcyst formation at the left cornu supports regional adenomyosis. No gross JZ expansion or discrete
adenomyoma. The junctional zone measurement average is diffusely 8mm.
Uterine lesions: Multi focal fibroids. The lesions are non degenerate and non suspicious. The largest most relevant fibroids as follows:-
1.Left sided pedunculated posterior subserosal filling the posterior cul-de-sac. Size: 89 x 71 x 11cm. Base of attachment 3.8cm.
2.Posterior lower uterine body midline. Subserosal. Size: 13mm.
3.Pedunculated right sided fundal, subserosal. Size: 29 x 25 x 26mm. Base of attachment 20mm.
4.Right sided intramural / subserosal, broad base of serosal contact measuring 32mm. Size: 34 x 34 x 27mm.
Cervix & vagina:

No cervical or vaginal lesions.
Left ovary:
Position: Left lateral adnexa.
Size: 29 x 22 x 24mm (8ml)
Follicle(s): Present. Approx. 3 follicles. Dominant follicle 19mm.
Lesions and/or endometrioma: Not identified.
Right ovary:
Position: Superior right hemipelvis at the iliac fossa. Displacement due to uterine enlargement.
Size: 44 x 32 x 35mm (26mls). Enlargement related to dominant follicular activity.
Follicle(s): Present. Two main follicles. Dominant follicle 35mm. Smaller follicle 17mm.
Lesions and/or endometrioma: Not identified.
Adnexa:
No abnormal fluid or mass. No hydrosalpinx. The large posterior pedunculated subserosal fundal fibroid almost completely fills the deep
posterior cul-de-sac. Normal physiologic fluid is present, without evidence of obliterative change. There are no rectal plaques identified.
The uterosacral ligaments appear appropriate. Vaginal vault unremarkable. Anterior cul-de-sac is clear.
Other findings:
Nil significant.
